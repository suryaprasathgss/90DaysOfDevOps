# Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice

## Part 1: Linux File System Hierarchy

Understanding where things live in Linux helps in faster debugging, automation, and incident response.

---

### / (Root Directory)
Starting point of the entire Linux file system.
All files and directories branch from here.

Command run:
```ls -l```

![practice](images/1.png)

Observed:
Directories like bin, etc, home, var, usr

I would use this when:
Navigating the system or understanding disk layout issues.

### /home

Contains home directories for all normal users.
User-specific files, configs, scripts live here.

Command run: 
```ls -l /home```

![practice](images/2.png)

Observed:
User directories like /home/ubuntu

I would use this when:
Checking user files, scripts, or permission issues.

### /root

Home directory for the root user.
Only accessible by root.

Command run:
```ls -l /root```

![practice](images/3.png)

Observed:
Root-owned files and configs

I would use this when:
Logged in as root during critical admin tasks.

### /etc

Contains system-wide configuration files.
No binaries, only configs.

Command run:
```ls -l /etc```

![practice](images/4.png)

Observed:
Files like hostname, hosts, ssh

I would use this when:
Debugging service configuration issues.

### /var/log

Stores logs generated by services and the system.
One of the most important directories for DevOps.

Command run:
```ls -l /var/log```

![practice](images/5.png)

Observed:
Logs for syslog, nginx, auth.log

I would use this when:
Investigating crashes, errors, or incidents.

### /tmp

Temporary files.
Usually cleared on reboot.

Command run:
```ls -l /tmp```

![practice](images/6.png)

Observed:
Temporary runtime files

I would use this when:
Creating temporary test files or scripts.

### /bin

Essential system binaries (ls, cp, mv).

Command run:
```ls -l /bin```

![practice](images/7.png)

I would use this when:
Running basic commands even in recovery mode.

### /usr/bin

User-level binaries installed by the OS or packages.

Command run:
```ls -l /usr/bin```

![practice](images/8.png)

I would use this when:
Working with installed tools like curl, git, docker.

### /opt

Optional or third-party applications.

Command run:
```ls -l /opt```

![practice](images/9.png)

I would use this when:
Managing custom or vendor applications.


### Hands-on task:

Find the largest log file in /var/log
```du -sh /var/log/* 2>/dev/null | sort -h | tail -5```

![practice](images/10.png)

Look at a config file in /etc
```cat /etc/hostname```

![practice](images/11.png)

Check your home directory
```ls -la ~```

## Part 2: Scenario-Based Practice
Important: Focus on understanding the troubleshooting flow, not memorizing commands. Use the hints!

### Scenario 1: Service Not Starting

**Problem:**
myapp failed to start after reboot.

**Step 1**
```systemctl status myapp```

Why: Checks whether the service is active, failed, or stopped.

**Step 2**

```journalctl -u myapp -n 50```

Why: Views recent logs to understand failure reason.

**Step 3**

```systemctl is-enabled myapp```

Why: Checks if the service starts automatically on boot.

**Step 4**

```systemctl list-units --type=service | grep myapp```

Why: Confirms if the service exists on the system.

### Scenario 2: High CPU Usage

**Problem:**
Server is slow.

**Step 1**

```top```

Why: Live view of CPU and memory usage.

**Step 2**

```ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10```

Why: Lists top CPU-consuming processes.

**Step 3**

```ps -p <PID> -o pid,pcpu,pmem,cmd```

Why: Inspect the exact process causing load.

### Scenario 3: Finding Service Logs (Docker)

**Step 1**

```systemctl status docker```

Why: Confirms service state and log hints.

**Step 2**

```journalctl -u docker -n 50```

Why: View recent logs.

**Step 3**

```journalctl -u docker -f```

Why: Follow logs in real time during debugging.

### Scenario 4: File Permission Issue

**Problem:**
backup.sh gives “Permission denied”.

**Step 1**

```ls -l /home/user/backup.sh```

Why: Check existing permissions.

**Step 2**

```chmod +x /home/user/backup.sh```

Why: Add execute permission.

**Step 3**

```ls -l /home/user/backup.sh```

Why: Verify executable flag.

**Step 4**

```./backup.sh```

Why: Confirm script execution.
